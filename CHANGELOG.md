# Riposte Microservice Template Changelog / Release Notes

All notable changes to the `Riposte Microservice Template` will be documented in this file. This is a template project 
and is not available via typical artifact repositories (JCenter, Maven Central, etc), therefore it does not have version 
numbers. This file will track changes based on the dates the changes were made.

## 2018-02-22

### `projecttemplate/kotlin` branch

- Added a Kotlin version of the Riposte microservice template.

## 2018-02-22

### Added

- Added dependency on `com.google.code.findbugs:jsr305` - this ensures Guice can see `@Nullable` annotations after 
removing example code. Previously `@Nullable` was being transitively pulled in by other dependencies that aren't 
needed for all projects (e.g. Eureka dependencies).
- Added a unit test to cover `ProjectApiError.getMetadata()` so that code coverage stays at 100% after removing 
example code.

## 2018-02-21

### Updated

- Updated Jackson dependencies to explicitly specify version `2.9.4` for all modules that were being pulled in 
transitively.

### Other

- Moved endpoint matchers to constants to prevent unnecessary object creation.
- Added to the manual-error-throwing example in `ExampleEndpoint.Post` to show how you can specify extra logs and/or
response headers when throwing an `ApiException`.
- Cleaned up various code warnings.
- Removed a test that was there for code coverage which became unnecessary with the upgrade to Jacoco 0.8.0. 
- Force gradle to always execute the `functionalTest` task when specified, even if no code changes have occurred.
