########## EUREKA STUFF #############
# TODO: EXAMPLE CLEANUP - If you don't use Eureka then you can remove these Eureka-related properties.
# NOTE: We default eureka to off/disabled since not everyone needs it.
#   If you've setup eureka locally and want to use it you can turn it on.
#   For an easy local eureka server compatible with the following properties clone the Riposte library repository
#   at https://github.com/Nike-Inc/riposte, cd into riposte-service-registration-eureka,
#   and use vagrant to launch the included VM with `vagrant up`.
